# CARPI Automated Framework
The Cancer Radiomic and Perfusion Imaging (CARPI) automated framework is a Python-based software application that is vendor- and sequence-neutral. CARPI uses contour files generated using an application of the user's choice and performs automated radiomic feature extraction and perfusion analysis. 
NOTE: A PostgreSQL database should be configured before using CARPI.
